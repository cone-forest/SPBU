Is self-teaching better than studying at school?
In my opinion those two can't replace each other as they are mutually-dependable.

The first reason is that one definetly can't get everything that's being taught at school so he/she has to study difficult topics on their own.
The second reason comes from the fact that most educational resources come from some form of school (online, commertial, college, etc.).
As for the conclusion there definetly is more to education methods than just company that you are studying with.
